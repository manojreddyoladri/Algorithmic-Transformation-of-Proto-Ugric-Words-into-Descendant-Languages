# Algorithmic-Transformation-of-Proto-Ugric-Words-into-Descendant-Languages

Implemented a regular sound change algorithm for Sumerian-Ugric protowords based on the set of sixteen rules given in Table 3 of the Appendix of
the Etymological Dictionary of the Sumerian Language. The algorithm takes input a Proto-Ugric word and apply the rules to generate Hungarian, Khanty, Mansi, and Sumerian words. Generates all possible words in case of an ambiguity.
